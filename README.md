# ToDo



The idea is to create a todo list type app with the ability to track user input using streamreader and storing data in dictionary. 



I will create a point reward system attached to input that will also track points and store them.




Can create User interface in windows form.

Got some interesting ideas from Supply Code Build Night in Pittsburgh last night. Will begin physically building this evening after class 2/28



Working on setting up app 3/16
